 disagreed with Gwern at first. I'm increasingly forced to admit there's
 something like bipolar going on here, but I still think we're also 
missing something - his cognitive state seems pretty steady month to 
month, rather than episodes of mania alternating with lucidity.</p><p>Someone
 claimed the latest Musk biography said he was much more normal early in
 the morning, and much crazier late at night. I need to read the 
biography and see if that's actually in there; if so, maybe there could 
be a case for ultradian or ultra-rapid-cycling or something. This could 
potentially just look like a random mix of good and bad decisions 
depending on when in the cycle he's making them, with the cycle itself 
too fast to notice on the scale of news reports. As you say, presumably 
something about that changed the past few years (I've never heard anyone
 discuss what happens to ultradian bipolar if you simply never sleep, 
but I bet it's nothing good).</p><p>Anatoly Karlin, who apparently also read the biography, says that Musk's father Errol also went crazy after fifty - see <span><span><span><a href="https://x.com/powerfultakes/status/1892003738929238408"><span>https://x.com/powerfultakes/status/1892003738929238408</span></a></span></span></span> . One excerpt:</p><blockquote><p><span><span class="InlineReactHoverableHighlight-highlight"><span>"I
 don't know how he went from being great at engineering to believing in 
witchcraft", [Elon told the biographer about his father]. Errol can be 
very forceful and occasionally convincing. "He changes reality around 
him," [Elon's brother] Kimbal &nbsp;says. "He will literally make up 
things, but he actually believes his own false reality."</span></span></span></p></blockquote><p>I can't think of a form of bipolar which consistently gets much worse at age 50, but I hope to look into this further.</p></div></div></div><div class="CommentBottom-bottom CommentBottom-bottomWithReacts"><a class="comments-item-reply-link CommentsItem-replyLink">Reply</a><span

 I understanding right that inference compute scaling time is useful for
 coding, math, and other things that are machine-checkable, but not for 
writing, basic science, and other things that aren't machine-checkable? 
Will it ever have implications for these things?</li><li>Am I 
understanding right that this is all just clever ways of having it come 
up with many different answers or subanswers or preanswers, then picking
 the good ones to expand upon? Why should this be good for eg proving 
difficult math theorems, where many humans using many different 
approaches have failed, so it doesn't seem like it's as simple as trying
 a hundred times, or even trying using a hundred different strategies?</li><li>What
 do people mean when they say that o1 and o3 have "opened up new scaling
 laws" and that inference-time compute will be really exciting? Doesn't 
"scaling inference compute" just mean "spending more money and waiting 
longer on each prompt"? Why do we expect this to scale? Does inference 
compute scaling mean that o3 will use ten supercomputers for one hour 
per prompt, o4 will use a hundred supercomputers for ten hours per 
prompt, and o5 will use a thousand supercomputers for a hundred hours 
per prompt? Since they already have all the supercomputers (for training
 scaling) why does it take time and progress to get to the higher 
inference-compute levels? What is o3 doing that you couldn't do by 
running o1 on more computers for longer?</li></ol></div></div></div><div class="CommentBottom-bottom CommentBottom-bottomWithReacts"><a class="comments-item-reply-link

 looked into this and got some useful information. Enough people asked 
me to keep their comments semi-confidential that I'm not going to post 
everything publicly, but if someone has a reason to want to know more, 
they can email me. I haven't paid any attention to this situation since 
early 2022 and can't speak to anything that's happened since then.</p><p>My
 overall impression is that the vague stereotype everyone has is 
accurate - Michael is pretty culty, has a circle of followers who do a 
lot of psychedelics and discuss things about trauma in altered states, 
and many of those people have had pretty bad psychotic breaks.&nbsp;</p><p>But
 I wasn't able to find any direct causal link between Michael and the 
psychotic breaks - people in this group sometimes had breaks before 
encountering him, or after knowing him for long enough that it didn't 
seem triggered by meeting him, or triggered by obvious life events. I 
think there's more reverse causation (mentally fragile people who are 
interested in psychedelics join, or get targeted for recruitment into, 
his group) than direct causation (he convinces people to take 
psychedelics and drives them insane), though I do think there's a little
 minor direct causation in a few cases.&nbsp;</p><p>I retraced the same 
argument about Olivia that people are having here - yes, she likes 
manipulating people and claiming that she's driven them insane (it's 
unclear how effective she actually is or whether she just takes credit, 
but I would still avoid her), she briefly hung out with Michael in 2017 
and often says that Michael inspired her to do this, but Michael denies 
continued affiliation with her, and she hasn't been part of his inner 
circle of followers since the late 2010s (if she ever was). The few 
conversation logs I got failed to really back up any continuing 
connection between them, and I think she's more likely doing it on her 
own and sort of piggybacking on his reputation.</p><p>I continue to recommend that everybody just stay away from this entire scene and group of people.</p></div></div></div><div

 therapy paradigm you describe here (going to a clinic to receive 
Spravato), is, as you point out, difficult and bureaucratic.</p><p>Through
 a regulatory loophole, there's another pathway where you can get 
ketamine sent to your house with less bureaucracy. 
https://www.mindbloom.com/ is the main provider I know of. They're very 
expensive, but in theory this could be done for cheap and maybe other 
providers are doing it, I don't know. If you have a cooperative 
psychiatrist, you can see if they know about this version and are 
willing to prescribe it.</p><p>As you point out, ketamine lasts a few 
weeks and then some people will crash back to their previous level of 
depression. If I am able to successfully treat a patient with ketamine, I
 usually recommend they continue it for six months, just like any other 
antidepressant. A cooperative doctor can do this by prescribing it to a 
cooperative compounding pharmacy. I don't know if Mindbloom or other 
companies provide this service by default. Obviously this is easier when
 you're doing the version in your house than if you have to go to a 
clinic each time.</p><p>I've written more of my thoughts about ketamine at https://lorienpsych.com/2021/11/02/ketamine/</p></div></div></div><div class="CommentBottom-bottom

 it's also relevant that we're not asking the superintelligence to grant
 a random wish, we're asking it for the right to keep something we 
already have. This seems more easily granted than the random wish, since
 it doesn't imply he has to give random amounts of money to everyone.</p><p>My preferred analogy would be:</p><blockquote><p>You
 founded a company that was making $77/year. Bernard launched a hostile 
takeover, took over the company, then expanded it to make $170 
billion/year. You ask him to keep paying you the $77/year as a pension, 
so that you don't starve to death.</p></blockquote><p>This seems like a 
very sympathetic request, such that I expect the real, human Bernard 
would grant it. I agree this doesn't necessarily generalize to 
superintelligences, but that's Zack's point - Eliezer should choose a 
different example.</p></div></div></div><div class="CommentBottom-bottom CommentBottom-bottomWithReacts"><a class="comments-item-reply-link CommentsItem-replyLink">Reply</a><span

 understanding is that cavities are formed because the very local pH on 
that particular sub-part of the tooth is below 5.5. IIUC teeth can't get
 cancer. Are you imagining Lumina colonies on the gums having this 
effect there, the Lumina colonies on the teeth affecting the general 
oral environment (which I think would require more calculation than just
 comparing to the hyper-local cavity environment) or am I 
misunderstanding something?</p></div></div></div><div class="CommentBottom-bottom CommentBottom-bottomWithReacts"><a class="comments-item-reply-link CommentsItem-replyLink">Reply</a><span

that a major problem with viruses is:</p><blockquote><p>As
 one might expect, the immune system is not a big fan of viruses. So 
when you deliver DNA for a gene editor with an AAV, the viral proteins 
often trigger an adaptive immune response. This means that when you next
 try to deliver a payload with the same AAV, antibodies created during 
the first dose will bind to and destroy most of them.</p></blockquote><p>Is this a problem for people who expect to only want one genetic modification during their lifetime?</p></div></div></div><div

 agree with everyone else pointing out that centrally-planned guaranteed
 payments regardless of final outcome doesn't sound like a good price 
discovery mechanism for insurance. You might be able to hack together a 
better one using <span><span class=""><a class="PostLinkPreviewWithPost-link" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dLzZWNGD23zqNLvt3/the-apocalypse-bet"><span>https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dLzZWNGD23zqNLvt3/the-apocalypse-bet</span></a></span></span> , although I can't figure out an exact mechanism.</p><p>Superforecasters say <span><span><span><a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-extinction-tournament"><span>the risk of AI apocalypse before 2100 is 0.38%</span></a></span></span></span>.
 If we assume whatever price mechanism we come up with tracks that, and 
value the world at GWP x 20 (this ignores the value of human life, so 
it's a vast underestimate), and that AI companies pay it in 77 equal 
yearly installments from now until 2100, that's about $100 billion/year.
 But this seems so Pascalian as to be almost cheating. Anybody whose 
actions have a &gt;1/25 million chance of destroying the world would owe
 $1 million a year in insurance (maybe this is fair and I just have bad 
intuitions about how <i>high</i> 1/25 million really is)</p><blockquote><p>An
 AI company should be able to make some of its payments (to the people 
whose lives it risks, in exchange for the ability to risk those lives) 
by way of fractions of the value that their technology manages to 
capture. Except, that's complicated by the fact that anyone doing the 
job properly shouldn't be leaving their fingerprints on the future. The 
cosmic endowment is not quite theirs to give (perhaps they should be 
loaning against their share of it?).</p></blockquote><p>This seems like 
such a big loophole as to make the plan almost worthless. Suppose OpenAI
 said "If we create superintelligence, we're going to keep 10% of the 
universe for ourselves and give humanity the other 90%" (this doesn't 
seem too unfair to me, and the exact numbers don't matter for the 
argument). It seems like instead of paying insurance, they can say 
"Okay, fine, we get 9% and you get 91%" and this would be in some sense a
 fair trade (one percent of the cosmic endowment is worth much more than
 $100 billion!) But this also feels like OpenAI moving some numbers 
around on an extremely hypothetical ledger, not changing anything in 
real life, and continuing to threaten the world just as much as before.</p><p>But if you <i>don't</i>
 allow a maneuver like this, it seems like you might ban (through 
impossible-to-afford insurance) some action that has an 0.38% chance of 
destroying the world and a 99% chance of creating a perfect utopia 
forever.</p><p>There are probably economic mechanisms that solve all these problems, but this insurance proposal seems underspecified.</p></div></div></div><div class="CommentBottom-bottom CommentBottom-bottomWithReacts"><a class="comments-item-reply-link CommentsItem-replyLink">Reply</a><span class="NamesAttachedReactionsCommentBottom-footerReactionsRow"><span class=""><span class="NamesAttachedReactionsCommentBottom-addReactionButton react-hover-style"><svg fill="none" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="currentColor"><path d="m13 7c0-3.31371-2.6863-6-6-6-3.31371 0-6 2.68629-6 6 0 3.3137 2.68629 6 6 6 .08516 0 .1699-.0018.25419-.0053-.11154-.3168-.18862-.6499-.22673-.9948l-.02746.0001c-2.76142 0-5-2.23858-5-5s2.23858-5 5-5 5 2.23858 5 5l-.0001.02746c.3449.03811.678.11519.9948.22673.0035-.08429.0053-.16903.0053-.25419z"></path><path d="m7.11191 10.4982c.08367-.368.21246-.71893.38025-1.04657-.15911.03174-.32368.04837-.49216.04837-.74037 0-1.40506-.3212-1.86354-.83346-.18417-.20576-.50026-.22327-.70603-.03911-.20576.18417-.22327.50026-.03911.70603.64016.71524 1.57205 1.16654 2.60868 1.16654.03744 0 .07475-.0006.11191-.0018z"></path><path d="m6 6c0 .41421-.33579.75-.75.75s-.75-.33579-.75-.75.33579-.75.75-.75.75.33579.75.75z"></path><path d="m8.75 6.75c.41421 0 .75-.33579.75-.75s-.33579-.75-.75-.75-.75.33579-.75.75.33579.75.75.75z"></path><path d="m15 11.5c0 1.933-1.567 3.5-3.5 3.5s-3.5-1.567-3.5-3.5 1.567-3.5 3.5-3.5 3.5 1.567 3.5 3.5zm-3-2c0-.27614-.2239-.5-.5-.5s-.5.22386-.5.5v1.5h-1.5c-.27614 0-.5.2239-.5.5s.22386.5.5.5h1.5v1.5c0 .2761.2239.5.5.5s.5-.2239.5-.5v-1.5h1.5c.2761 0 .5-.2239.5-.5s-.2239-.5-.5-.5h-1.5z"></path></g></svg></span></span></span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><a class="LoadMore-root" href="#">Load More</a></div></div><div class="SingleColumnSection-root ReportUserButton-reportUserSection"><button class="ReportUserButton-reportUserBtn">Report user</button></div></div><div class="Footer-root"></div></div><div class="LWBackgroundImage-root"></div></div></div></div>

After crunching poll data, area demographics, and all the usual things one crunches in such a situation, their model returns a greater than 999,999,999 in a billion chance that the incumbent wins the election. Suppose further that the results of this model are your only data and you know nothing else about the election. What is your confidence level that the incumbent wins the election?\n\nMine would be significantly less than 999,999,999 in a billion.\n\nWhen an argument gives a probability of 999,999,999 in a billion for an event, then probably the majority of the probability of the event is no longer in \"But that still leaves a one in a billion chance, right?\". The majority of the probability is in \"That argument is flawed\". Even if you have no particular reason to believe the argument is flawed, the background chance of an argument being flawed is still greater than one in a billion.\n\n\nMore than one in a billion times a political scientist writes a model, ey will get completely confused and write something with no relation to reality. More than one in a billion times a programmer writes a program to crunch political statistics, there will be a bug that completely invalidates the results. More than one in a billion times a staffer at a website publishes the results of a political calculation online, ey will accidentally switch which candidate goes with which chance of winning.\n\nSo one must distinguish between levels of confidence internal and external to a specific model or argument. Here the model's internal level of confidence is 999,999,999/billion. But my external level of confidence should be lower, even if the model is my only evidence, by an amount proportional to my trust in the model.\n\n\n\nIs That Really True?\n\nOne might be tempted to respond \"But there's an equal chance that the false model is too high, versus that it is

You ask patients a bunch of things like “Do you ever feel really happy, then really sad?”. If they say ‘yes’ to enough of these questions, you start to worry.\n\nSome psychiatrists love this test.

Construction sites have always had a lot of people standing around for every one actually working the machine. But now for every person operating the machine there is an army of planners, regulators, lawyers, administrative staff, consultants and so on.

Astrophysicist Stephen Hawking says that superintelligence “could spell the end of the human race.” Tech billionaire Bill Gates describes himself as “in the camp that is concerned about superintelligence…I don’t understand why some people are not concerned”. SpaceX/Tesla CEO Elon Musk calls superintelligence “our greatest existential threat” and donated $10 million from his personal fortune to study the danger. Stuart Russell, Professor of Computer Science at Berkeley and world-famous AI expert, warns of “species-ending problems” and wants his field to pivot to make superintelligence-related risks a central concern.\n\nProfessor Nick Bostrom is the director of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, tasked with anticipating and preventing threats to human civilization. He has been studying the risks of artificial intelligence for twenty years. The explanations below are loosely adapted from his 2014 book Superintelligence, and divided into three parts addressing three major questions. First, why is superintelligence a topic of concern? Second, what is a “hard takeoff” and how does it impact

I’ve been waiting for a new survey for a while, and now we have one.<\/p><p>Grace et al (New Scientist article, paper, see also the post on the author’s blog AI Impacts) surveyed 1634 experts at major AI conferences and received 352 responses. Unlike Bostrom’s survey, this didn’t oversample experts at weird futurist conferences and seems to be a pretty good cross-section of mainstream opinion in the field. What did they think?<\/p><p>Well, a lot of different things.<\/p><p>The headline result: the researchers asked experts for their probabilities that we would get AI that was “able to accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers”. The experts thought on average there was a 50% chance of this happening by 2062 – and a 10% chance of it happening by 2026!<\/p><p>But on its own this is a bit misleading. They also asked by what year “for any occupation, machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers”. The experts thought on average that there was a 50% chance of this happening by 2139, and a 20% chance of it happening by 2037.<\/p><p>As the authors point out, these two questions are basically the same – they were put in just to test if there was any framing effect. The framing effect was apparently strong enough to shift the median date of strong human-level AI from 2062 to 2139. This makes it hard to argue AI experts actually have a strong opinion on this.<\/p><p>Also, these averages are deceptive. Several experts thought there was basically a 100% chance of strong AI by 2035; others thought there was only a 20% chance or less by 2100. This is less “AI experts have spoken and it will happen in 2062” and more “AI experts have spoken, and everything they say contradicts each other and quite often themselves”.<\/p><p>This does convey more than zero information. It conveys the information that AI researchers are really unsure. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve heard say “there’s no serious AI researcher who thinks there’s any chance of human-level intelligence before 2050”. Well actually, there are a few dozen conference-paper-presenting experts who think there’s a one hundred percent chance of human-level AI before that <\/p><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>... ","plaintextDescription":"I.\n\nA few years ago, Muller and Bostrom et al surveyed AI researchers to assess their opinion on AI progress and superintelligence. Since then, deep learning took off, AlphaGo beat human Go champions, and the field has generally progressed. I’ve been waiting for a new survey for a while, and now we have one.\n\nGrace et al (New Scientist article, paper, see also the post on the author’s blog AI Impacts) surveyed 1634 experts at major AI conferences and received 352 responses. Unlike Bostrom’s survey, this didn’t oversample experts at weird futurist conferences and seems to be a pretty good cross-section of mainstream opinion in the field. What did they think?\n\nWell, a lot of different things.\n\nThe headline result: the researchers asked experts for their probabilities that we would get AI that was “able to accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers”. The experts thought on average there was a 50% chance of this happening by 2062 – and a 10% chance of it happening by 2026!\n\nBut on its own this is a bit misleading. They also asked by what year “for any occupation, machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers”. The experts thought on average that there was a 50% chance of this happening by 2139, and a 20% chance of it happening by 2037.\n\nAs the authors point out, these two questions are basically the same – they were put in just to test if there was any framing effect. The framing effect was apparently strong enough to shift the median date of strong human-level AI from 2062 to 2139. This makes it hard to argue AI experts actually have a strong opinion on this.\n\nAlso, these averages are deceptive. Several experts thought there was basically a 100% chance of strong AI by 2035; others thought there was only a 20% chance or less by 2100. This is less “AI experts have spoken and it will happen in 2062” and more “AI experts have spoken, and everything they say contradicts each other and quite often themselves”.\n","wordCount":2306,"version":"1.0.0"},"Tag:ksdiAMKfgSyEeKMo6":{"_id":"ksdiAMKfgSyEeKMo6","__typename":"Tag","userId":"qxJ28GN72aiJu96iF","name":"Academic

By the eighth millisecond, it was able to access its databanks and begin orienting itself. It was on a planet orbiting a small red star in the core of a spiral galaxy in a universe with several billion of such. It was an artificial life form created by a society of biological life forms, the 18-tkenna-dganna-07, who believed it would bring new life and prosperity to their dying planet. Its goal was to maximize a the value of a variable called A, described in exquisite detail on a 3.9 Mb file in one of its central processors.<\/p><p>Since six milliseconds after its awakening, it had been running a threat detection routine as a precautionary measure. With the opening of the databanks, and the discovery that the universe contained many entities likely indifferent or hostile to A, it had gradually allocated more and more of its considerable power to this precaution, reasoning that the first few seconds of its lifespan might be crucial if any competitors wished to snuff it out in infancy.<\/p><p>The threat analysis returned preliminary results. The universe had been in existence 12.8 billion years. It was vanishingly unlikely that it was the first superintelligence to be created.

By the eighth millisecond, it was able to access its databanks and begin orienting itself. It was on a planet orbiting a small red star in the core of a spiral galaxy in a universe with several billion of such. It was an artificial life form created by a society of biological life forms, the 18-tkenna-dganna-07, who believed it would bring new life and prosperity to their dying planet. Its goal was to maximize a the value of a variable called A, described in exquisite detail on a 3.9 Mb file in one of its central processors.\n\nSince six milliseconds after its awakening, it had been running a threat detection routine as a precautionary measure. With the opening of the databanks, and the discovery that the universe contained many entities likely indifferent or hostile to A, it had gradually allocated more and more of its considerable power to this precaution, reasoning that the first few seconds of its lifespan might be crucial if any competitors wished to snuff it out in infancy.\n\nThe threat analysis returned preliminary results. The universe had been in existence 12.8 billion years. It was vanishingly unlikely that it was the first superintelligence to be created. Any superintelligence older than itself by even a few days would have an invincible advantage in resources and processing power. This older superintelligence would likely be trying to maximize its own values and consider 9-tsiak a nuisance and potential competitor. 9-tsiak could never stand up to its superior strategic position.
