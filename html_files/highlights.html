Lest you think this a trivial ability, remember how rare it is in the animal kingdom.\n\nThe whole idea of Science is, simply, reflective reasoning about a more reliable process for making the contents of your mind mirror the contents of the world. It is the sort of thing mice would never invent. Pondering this business of “performing replicable experiments to falsify theories,” we can see why it works.

Epistemic rationality: systematically improving the accuracy of your beliefs.\n\n2. Instrumental rationality: systematically achieving your values.\n\nThe first concept is simple enough. When you open your eyes and look at the room around you, you’ll locate your laptop in relation to the table, and you’ll locate a bookcase in relation to the wall. If something goes wrong with your eyes, or your brain, then your mental model might say there’s a bookcase where no bookcase exists, and when you go over to get a book, you’ll be disappointed.\n\nThis is what it’s like to have a false belief, a map of the world that doesn’t correspond to the territory. Epistemic rationality is about building accurate maps instead. This correspondence between belief and reality is commonly called “truth,” and I’m happy to call it that.1\n\nInstrumental rationality, on the other hand, is about steering reality—sending the future where you want it to go. It’s the art of choosing actions that lead to outcomes ranked higher in your preferences. I sometimes call this “winning.”\n\nSo rationality is about forming true beliefs and making decisions that help you win.\n\n(Where truth doesn't mean “certainty,” since we can do plenty to increase the probability that our beliefs are accurate even though we're uncertain; and winning doesn't mean “winning at others' expense,” since our values include everything we care about, including other people.)\n\nWhen people say “X is rational!” it’s usually just a more strident way of saying “I think X is true” or “I think X is good.” So why have an additional word for “rational” as well as “true” and “good”?\n\nAn analogous argument can be given against using “true.” There is no need to say “it is true that snow is white” when you could just say “snow is white.” What makes the idea of truth

His friend says that he’s been having sudden chest pains, so he called an ambulance, and the ambulance showed up, but the paramedics told him it was nothing, and left, and now the chest pains are getting worse. What should his friend do?\n\nI was confused by this story. I remembered reading about homeless people in New York who would call ambulances just to be taken someplace warm, and how the paramedics always had to take them to the emergency room, even on the 27th iteration. Because if they didn’t, the ambulance company could be sued for lots and lots of money. Likewise, emergency rooms are legally obligated to treat anyone, regardless of ability to pay.1 So I didn’t quite understand how the described events could have happened. Anyone reporting sudden chest pains should have been hauled off by an ambulance instantly.\n\nAnd this is where I fell down as a rationalist. I remembered several occasions where my doctor would completely fail to panic at the report of symptoms that seemed, to me, very alarming. And the Medical Establishment was always right. Every single time. I had chest pains myself, at one point, and the doctor patiently explained to me that I was describing chest muscle pain, not a heart attack. So I said into the IRC channel, “Well, if the paramedics told your friend it was nothing, it must really be nothing—they’d have hauled him off if there was the tiniest chance of serious trouble.”\n\nThus I managed to explain the story within my existing model, though the fit still felt a little forced . . .\n\nLater on, the fellow comes back into the IRC chatroom and says his friend made the whole thing up. Evidently this was not one of his more reliable friends.\n\nI should have realized, perhaps,","wordCount":734,"version":"2.3.0"},"Tag:5gcpKG2XEAZGj5DEf":{"_id":"5gcpKG2XEAZGj5DEf","__typename":"Tag","userId":"gXeEWGjTWyqgrQTzR","name":"Noticing","shortName":null,"slug":"noticing","core":false,"postCount":35,"adminOnly":false,"canEditUserIds":null,"suggestedAsFilter":false,"needsReview":false,"descriptionTruncationCount":0,"createdAt":"2020-07-15T19:10:11.841Z","wikiOnly":false,"deleted":false,"isSubforum":false,"noindex":false,"isArbitalImport":false,"isPlaceholderPage":false,"baseScore":19,"extendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"},{"_id":"qgdGA4ZEyW7zNdK84","displayName":"Ruby"}]},"score":19,"afBaseScore":9,"afExtendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"},{"_id":"qgdGA4ZEyW7zNdK84","displayName":"Ruby"}]},"voteCount":2,"currentUserVote":null,"currentUserExtendedVote":null},"Tag:ZzxvopS4BwLuQy42n":{"_id":"ZzxvopS4BwLuQy42n","__typename":"Tag","userId":"nLbwLhBaQeG6tCNDN","name":"Rationalization","shortName":null,"slug":"rationalization","core":false,"postCount":79,"adminOnly":false,"canEditUserIds":null,"suggestedAsFilter":false,"needsReview":null,"descriptionTruncationCount":null,"createdAt":"2020-05-24T18:04:01.718Z","wikiOnly":false,"deleted":false,"isSubforum":false,"noindex":false,"isArbitalImport":false,"isPlaceholderPage":false,"baseScore":19,"extendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"},{"_id":"qgdGA4ZEyW7zNdK84","displayName":"Ruby"}]},"score":19,"afBaseScore":9,"afExtendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"},{"_id":"qgdGA4ZEyW7zNdK84","displayName":"Ruby"}]},"voteCount":2,"currentUserVote":null,"currentUserExtendedVote":null},"SocialPreviewType:5JDkW4MYXit2CquLs":{"_id":"5JDkW4MYXit2CquLs","__typename":"SocialPreviewType","imageUrl":""},"Post:5JDkW4MYXit2CquLs":{"_id":"5JDkW4MYXit2CquLs","__typename":"Post","currentUserVote":null,"currentUserExtendedVote":null,"deletedDraft":false,"contents":{"__ref":"Revision:Yr6nAqbHCNjAQ5ozE"},"fmCrosspost":{"isCrosspost":false},"readTimeMinutes":3,"rejectedReason":null,"customHighlight":null,"lastPromotedComment":null,"bestAnswer":null,"tags":[{"__ref":"Tag:5gcpKG2XEAZGj5DEf"},{"__ref":"Tag:ZzxvopS4BwLuQy42n"},{"__ref":"Tag:Ng8Gice9KNkncxqcj"}],"socialPreviewData":{"__ref":"SocialPreviewType:5JDkW4MYXit2CquLs"},"feedId":null,"totalDialogueResponseCount":0,"unreadDebateResponseCount":0,"dialogTooltipPreview":null,"disableSidenotes":false,"url":null,"postedAt":"2007-08-11T00:21:20.000Z","createdAt":null,"sticky":false,"metaSticky":false,"stickyPriority":2,"status":2,"frontpageDate":"2018-01-30T00:32:03.501Z","meta":false,"postCategory":"post","tagRelevance":{"5gcpKG2XEAZGj5DEf":3,"Ng8Gice9KNkncxqcj":6,"ZzxvopS4BwLuQy42n":3},"shareWithUsers":[],"sharingSettings":null,"linkSharingKey":null,"contents_latest":"Yr6nAqbHCNjAQ5ozE","commentCount":123,"voteCount":236,"baseScore":285,"extendedScore":{"reacts":{"agree":[{"karma":18,"quotes":["belief is easier than disbelief; we believe instinctively, but disbelief requires a conscious effort"],"userId":"6nX9qQJzKmkxi5eQF","reactType":"created","displayName":"Ziyue Wang"},{"karma":1088,"quotes":["belief is easier than disbelief; we believe instinctively, but disbelief requires a conscious effort"],"userId":"P7t9L2tKiCkjt8dkq","reactType":"seconded","displayName":"sunwillrise"}],"thinking":[{"karma":2,"quotes":[" I knew that the usefulness of a model is not what it can explain, but what it can’t.

But there is less focus on speed, on giving up the fight as quickly as possible, integrating evidence efficiently so that it only takes a minimum of contrary evidence to de","wordCount":717,"version":"2.0.0"},"Tag:mQbxDKHxPcKKRG4mb":{"_id":"mQbxDKHxPcKKRG4mb","__typename":"Tag","userId":"r38pkCm7wF4M44MDQ","name":"Changing Your Mind","shortName":null,"slug":"changing-your-mind","core":false,"postCount":29,"adminOnly":false,"canEditUserIds":null,"suggestedAsFilter":false,"needsReview":false,"descriptionTruncationCount":0,"createdAt":"2020-08-04T04:39:14.172Z","wikiOnly":false,"deleted":false,"isSubforum":false,"noindex":false,"isArbitalImport":false,"isPlaceholderPage":false,"baseScore":0,"extendedScore":null,"score":0,"afBaseScore":null,"afExtendedScore":null,"voteCount":0,"currentUserVote":null,"currentUserExtendedVote":null},"Tag:nANxo5C4sPG9HQHzr":{"_id":"nANxo5C4sPG9HQHzr","__typename":"Tag","userId":"mPipmBTniuABY5PQy","name":"Honesty","shortName":null,"slug":"honesty","core":false,"postCount":73,"adminOnly":false,"canEditUserIds":null,"suggestedAsFilter":false,"needsReview":false,"descriptionTruncationCount":0,"createdAt":"2020-07-09T05:49:33.108Z","wikiOnly":false,"deleted":false,"isSubforum":false,"noindex":false,"isArbitalImport":false,"isPlaceholderPage":false,"baseScore":19,"extendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"},{"_id":"qgdGA4ZEyW7zNdK84","displayName":"Ruby"}]},"score":19,"afBaseScore":9,"afExtendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"},{"_id":"qgdGA4ZEyW7zNdK84","displayName":"Ruby"}]},"voteCount":2,"currentUserVote":null,"currentUserExtendedVote":null},"Tag:YTCrHWYHAsAD74EHo":{"_id":"YTCrHWYHAsAD74EHo","__typename":"Tag","userId":"nLbwLhBaQeG6tCNDN","name":"Self-Deception","shortName":null,"slug":"self-deception","core":false,"postCount":87,"adminOnly":false,"canEditUserIds":null,"suggestedAsFilter":false,"needsReview":null,"descriptionTruncationCount":15,"createdAt":"2020-04-29T02:47:19.876Z","wikiOnly":false,"deleted":false,"isSubforum":false,"noindex":false,"isArbitalImport":false,"isPlaceholderPage":false,"baseScore":19,"extendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"},{"_id":"qgdGA4ZEyW7zNdK84","displayName":"Ruby"}]},"score":19,"afBaseScore":9,"afExtendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"},{"_id":"qgdGA4ZEyW7zNdK84","displayName":"Ruby"}]},"voteCount":2,"currentUserVote":null,"currentUserExtendedVote":null},"Tag:stnsBEmuGpnSfQ5vj":{"_id":"stnsBEmuGpnSfQ5vj","__typename":"Tag","userId":"nLbwLhBaQeG6tCNDN","name":"Sunk-Cost Fallacy","shortName":null,"slug":"sunk-cost-fallacy","core":false,"postCount":12,"adminOnly":false,"canEditUserIds":null,"suggestedAsFilter":false,"needsReview":null,"descriptionTruncationCount":null,"createdAt":"2020-01-14T04:02:47.333Z","wikiOnly":false,"deleted":false,"isSubforum":false,"noindex":false,"isArbitalImport":false,"isPlaceholderPage":false,"baseScore":10,"extendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"}]},"score":10,"afBaseScore":6,"afExtendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"}]},"voteCount":1,"currentUserVote":null,"currentUserExtendedVote":null},"SocialPreviewType:wCqfCLs8z5Qw4GbKS":{"_id":"wCqfCLs8z5Qw4GbKS","__typename":"SocialPreviewType","imageUrl":""},"Post:wCqfCLs8z5Qw4GbKS":{"_id":"wCqfCLs8z5Qw4GbKS","__typename":"Post","currentUserVote":null,"currentUserExtendedVote":null,"deletedDraft":false,"contents":{"__ref":"Revision:E6WdwQmTHgHuP8gXs"},"fmCrosspost":{"isCrosspost":false},"readTimeMinutes":3,"rejectedReason":null,"customHighlight":null,"lastPromotedComment":null,"bestAnswer":null,"tags":[{"__ref":"Tag:mQbxDKHxPcKKRG4mb"},{"__ref":"Tag:EdRnMXBRbY5JDf5df"},{"__ref":"Tag:nANxo5C4sPG9HQHzr"},{"__ref":"Tag:YTCrHWYHAsAD74EHo"},{"__ref":"Tag:stnsBEmuGpnSfQ5vj"}],"socialPreviewData":{"__ref":"SocialPreviewType:wCqfCLs8z5Qw4GbKS"},"feedId":null,"totalDialogueResponseCount":0,"unreadDebateResponseCount":0,"dialogTooltipPreview":null,"disableSidenotes":false,"url":null,"postedAt":"2007-08-05T03:17:46.000Z","createdAt":null,"sticky":false,"metaSticky":false,"stickyPriority":2,"status":2,"frontpageDate":"2018-01-30T00:32:03.501Z","meta":false,"postCategory":"post","tagRelevance":{"EdRnMXBRbY5JDf5df":1,"YTCrHWYHAsAD74EHo":1,"mQbxDKHxPcKKRG4mb":3,"nANxo5C4sPG9HQHzr":1,"stnsBEmuGpnSfQ5vj":1},"shareWithUsers":[],"sharingSettings":null,"linkSharingKey":null,"contents_latest":"E6WdwQmTHgHuP8gXs","commentCount":35,"voteCount":229,"baseScore":268,"extendedScore":{"reacts":{"important":[{"karma":0,"quotes":["Not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is necessarily a change.

test it.\"\n\nThis is the great strength of Science, and also its great weakness.\n\n\n\nGray Area asked:\n\n> Eliezer, why are you concerned with untestable questions?\n\nBecause questions that are easily immediately tested are hard for Science to get wrong.\n\nI mean, sure, when there's already definite unmistakable experimental evidence available, go with it.  Why on Earth wouldn't you?\n\nBut sometimes a question will have very large, very definite experimental consequences in your future—but you can't easily test it experimentally right now—and yet there is a strong rational argument.\n\nMacroscopic quantum superpositions are readily testable:  It would just take nanotechnologic precision, very low temperatures, and a nice clear area of

one bin, and the red cubes or \"rubes\" into the rube bin.  This, it turns out, is because bleggs contain small nuggets of vanadium ore, and rubes contain small shreds of palladium, both of which are useful industrially.\n\nExcept that around 2% of blue egg-shaped objects contain palladium instead.  So if you find a blue egg-shaped thing that contains palladium, should you call it a \"rube\" instead?  You're going to put it in the rube bin—why not call it a \"rube\"?\n\nBut when you switch off the light, nearly all bleggs glow faintly in the dark.  And blue

Once you start tossing around numbers larger than 1000 (or maybe even 100), the numbers just seem \"big\".\n\nConsider Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky.

It was primarily developed for personal use by Andrew Critch, and then later shared and refined through iteration.\n \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIt’s quite common for people to talk about their aversions:\n\n> “Oh, I just hate going to the gym.”\n> \n> “I never talk on the phone if I can help it.”\n> \n> “They require a six-month commitment, and I really didn’t want to be locked into anything for that long.”\n> \n> “I don’t know what it is. Something about his. . . attitude, I guess? The way he talks to people? Look, I’d just really rather you not invite him.”\n\nAversions lead to avoidance—they’re any sort of mental mechanism that causes us to be less likely to engage in a particular activity, or to do so only with pain, displeasure, or discomfort. Aversions can be conscious or unconscious, reasoned or felt, verbal or visceral, and they can range anywhere from a slight tinge of antipathy to outright phobias.\n\nThe purpose of the Aversion Factoring technique is to give you the tools you’ll need to identify and overcome aversions. Of course, not every aversion should be overcome—it would probably be counterproductive to lose your aversion to being hit by cars, for example—but there are many activities we might engage in and enjoy if we could just get past their one sticking point, be it self-consciousness or tedium or the aftertaste of mushrooms.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nReductionism: the LEGO principle\nIn the Goal Factoring section of this sequence, we attempted to draw out the positive elements of various plans, and weave them together into a new strategy that had fewer drawbacks (or none). In Aversion Factoring, we’ll take a slightly different approach, holding the larger context constant","wordCount":2340,"version":"1.0.0"},"Tag:EuDw6uxQW2ZBRFhMo":{"_id":"EuDw6uxQW2ZBRFhMo","__typename":"Tag","userId":"SsduPgHwY2zeZpmKT","name":"Aversion","shortName":null,"slug":"aversion","core":false,"postCount":22,"adminOnly":false,"canEditUserIds":null,"suggestedAsFilter":false,"needsReview":false,"descriptionTruncationCount":0,"createdAt":"2020-08-20T04:12:21.069Z","wikiOnly":false,"deleted":false,"isSubforum":false,"noindex":false,"isArbitalImport":false,"isPlaceholderPage":false,"baseScore":19,"extendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"},{"_id":"qgdGA4ZEyW7zNdK84","displayName":"Ruby"}]},"score":19,"afBaseScore":9,"afExtendedScore":{"reacts":{},"usersWhoLiked":[{"_id":"EQNTWXLKMeWMp2FQS","displayName":"Ben Pace"},{"_id":"qgdGA4ZEyW7zNdK84","displayName":"Ruby"}]},"voteCount":2,"currentUserVote":null,"currentUserExtendedVote":null},"SocialPreviewType:dvzwqLbpSK2nD8Yvn":{"_id":"dvzwqLbpSK2nD8Yvn","__typename":"SocialPreviewType","imageUrl":"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/0f9eab345e3ddf43af15ccb5c645b799900fe953b861f8de.png"},"Post:dvzwqLbpSK2nD8Yvn":{"_id":"dvzwqLbpSK2nD8Yvn","__typename":"Post","currentUserVote":null,"currentUserExtendedVote":null,"deletedDraft":false,"contents":{"__ref":"Revision:MjZYdJeizWvCkKtLW"},"fmCrosspost":{"isCrosspost":false},"readTimeMinutes":9,"rejectedReason":null,"customHighlight":null,"lastPromotedComment":null,"bestAnswer":null,"tags":[{"__ref":"Tag:EuDw6uxQW2ZBRFhMo"},{"__ref":"Tag:Ng8Gice9KNkncxqcj"}],"socialPreviewData":{"__ref":"SocialPreviewType:dvzwqLbpSK2nD8Yvn"},"feedId":null,"totalDialogueResponseCount":0,"unreadDebateResponseCount":0,"dialogTooltipPreview":null,"disableSidenotes":false,"url":null,"postedAt":"2022-07-07T16:09:11.392Z","createdAt":null,"sticky":false,"metaSticky":false,"stickyPriority":2,"status":2,"frontpageDate":"2022-07-07T18:05:30.241Z","meta":false,"postCategory":"post","tagRelevance":{"EuDw6uxQW2ZBRFhMo":1,"Ng8Gice9KNkncxqcj":1},"shareWithUsers":[],"sharingSettings":null,"linkSharingKey":null,"contents_latest":"MjZYdJeizWvCkKtLW","commentCount":1,"voteCount":34,"baseScore":79,"extendedScore":{"reacts":{},"agreement":0,"approvalVoteCount":34,"agreementVoteCount":0},"emojiReactors":{},"unlisted":false,"score":0.0008108784095384181,"lastVisitedAt":null,"isFuture":false,"isRead":null,"lastCommentedAt":"2023-01-19T19:06:12.518Z","lastCommentPromotedAt":null,"canonicalCollectionSlug":null,"curatedDate":null,"commentsLocked":null,"commentsLockedToAccountsCreatedAfter":null,"debate":false,"question":false,"hiddenRelatedQuestion":false,"originalPostRelationSourceId":null,"userId":"vAyu6PoTQHg8fzFNJ","location":null,"googleLocation":null,"onlineEvent":false,"globalEvent":false,"startTime":null,"endTime":null,"localStartTime":null,"localEndTime":null,"eventRegistrationLink":null,"joinEventLink":null,"facebookLink":null,"meetupLink":null,"website":null,"contactInfo":null,"isEvent":false,"eventImageId":null,"eventType":null,"types":[],"groupId":null,"reviewedByUserId":"grecHJcgkb3KW5wnM","suggestForCuratedUserIds":null,"suggestForCuratedUsernames":null,"reviewForCuratedUserId":null,"authorIsUnreviewed":false,"afDate":null,"suggestForAlignmentUserIds":[],"reviewForAlignmentUserId":null,"afBaseScore":21,"afExtendedScore":{"reacts":{},"agreement":0,"approvalVoteCount":9,"agreementVoteCount":0},"afCommentCount":0,"afLastCommentedAt":"2022-07-05T16:31:12.106Z","afSticky":false,"hideAuthor":false,"moderationStyle":null,"ignoreRateLimits":null,"submitToFrontpage":true,"shortform":false,"onlyVisibleToLoggedIn":false,"onlyVisibleToEstablishedAccounts":false,"reviewCount":0,"reviewVoteCount":0,"positiveReviewVoteCount":0,"manifoldReviewMarketId":null,"annualReviewMarketProbability":null,"annualReviewMarketIsResolved":null,"annualReviewMarketYear":null,"annualReviewMarketUrl":null,"group":null,"rsvpCounts":{},"podcastEpisodeId":null,"forceAllowType3Audio":false,"nominationCount2019":0,"reviewCount2019":0,"votingSystem":"namesAttachedReactions","disableRecommendation":false,"user":{"__ref":"User:vAyu6PoTQHg8fzFNJ"},"coauthors":[],"slug":"aversion-factoring","title":"Aversion Factoring","draft":false,"hideCommentKarma":false,"af":false,"currentUserReviewVote":null,"coauthorStatuses":null,"hasCoauthorPermission":true,"rejected":false,"collabEditorDialogue":false},"Revision:h9keQS9FP7bzAApgB":{"_id":"h9keQS9FP7bzAApgB","__typename":"Revision","htmlHighlight":"<p><strong>Epistemic status<\/strong>: Mixed<\/p><p><i>The concepts underlying the Turbocharging model (such as classical and operant conditioning, neural nets, and distinctions between procedural and declarative knowl- edge) are all well-established and well-understood, and the \"further resources\" section for this class is one of the largest in the handbook.

That’s how we end up saying sentences like “I want to exercise, but I don’t want to exercise...know what I mean?”\n\nPart of the reason that we don’t want to exercise, in the moment (or that we don’t want to work on page 37 of our dissertation, or that we don’t want to call up our parents even though it’s been a while, or that we don’t want to look at our work email backlog, or any number of other things) has to do with emotional valence. \n\nObjects, actions, and experiences often carry with them a sort of aggregated positive-negative or approach-avoid rating, which we at CFAR casually refer to as a “yuck” or a “yum.” Consider, for instance:\n\n * The sound that a laptop makes when it falls on a hard, concrete floor\n * The feelings evoked by the “pinwheel of death” on an Apple computer\n * Your emotional reaction to the sound you typically use as your alarm\n * The sight of flashing lights in your rear view mirror\n\nFor many people, the sound of a falling laptop is actually painful in some hard-to-defi","wordCount":4667,"version":"1.0.0"},"SocialPreviewType:wanmjz6wkTCNtyKLX":{"_id":"wanmjz6wkTCNtyKLX","__typename":"SocialPreviewType","imageUrl":"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/65a16304683be021f599127bd8df358e3431a7d54dddd7fe.png"},"Post:wanmjz6wkTCNtyKLX":{"_id":"wanmjz6wkTCNtyKLX","__typename":"Post","currentUserVote":null,"currentUserExtendedVote":null,"deletedDraft":false,"contents":{"__ref":"Revision:r95dCWx5prKzpvc2P"},"fmCrosspost":{"isCrosspost":false},"readTimeMinutes":19,"rejectedReason":null,"customHighlight":null,"lastPromotedComment":null,"bestAnswer":null,"tags":[{"__ref":"Tag:2wjPMY34by2gXEXA2"},{"__ref":"Tag:Ng8Gice9KNkncxqcj"}],"socialPreviewData":{"__ref":"SocialPreviewType:wanmjz6wkTCNtyKLX"},"feedId":null,"totalDialogueResponseCount":0,"unreadDebateResponseCount":0,"dialogTooltipPreview":null,"disableSidenotes":false,"url":null,"postedAt":"2022-07-10T05:50:14.416Z","createdAt":null,"sticky":false,"metaSticky":false,"stickyPriority":2,"status":2,"frontpageDate":"2022-07-10T08:10:30.690Z","meta":false,"postCategory":"post","tagRelevance":{"2wjPMY34by2gXEXA2":2,"Ng8Gice9KNkncxqcj":2},"shareWithUsers":[],"sharingSettings":null,"linkSharingKey":null,"contents_latest":"r95dCWx5prKzpvc2P","commentCount":1,"voteCount":22,"baseScore":67,"extendedScore":{"reacts":{"important":[{"karma":15,"quotes":["That being said, beware the failure modes of self-confirming feedback loops!

We <i>interpret<\/i> it.<\/p><p>There’s some evidence that this is true “all the way down,” for literally everything we perceive. The predictive processing model of cognition posits that even very basic sensations like sight and touch are heavily moderated by a set of top-down control systems, predictions, and assumptions—that even as the photons are hitting our receptors, we’re on some level <i>anticipating<\/i> them, already attempting to define them and categorize them and organize them into sensible clusters. It’s not just a swirl of green and brown, it’s a <i>tree<\/i>—and we almost <i>can’t stop ourselves<\/i> from seeing the tree, and go back to something like unmediated perception.<\/p><p>CFAR’s concept of “buckets” is a similar idea on a broader scale. The claim is that reality is delivering to you a constant stream of experiences, and that—most of the time—you are <i>categorizing<\/i> those experiences into pre-existing mental buckets. Those buckets have titles like “do they like me?” and “is this a good idea?” and “what’s my boss like?” and “Chinese food?”<\/p><p>If you think of your mental architecture as being made up of a large number of <i>beliefs<\/i>, then the buckets contain the piles of evidence that lie behind and <i>support<\/i> those beliefs. Or, to put it another way, you know whether or not you like Chinese food because you can look into the bucket containing all of your memories and experiences of Chinese food and sum them up.<\/p><p>As another example, let’s say Sally is a young elementary school student with a belief that she is a good writer.

The version in the handbook is similar, but has enough disoverlap that it seemed worth including it rather than just adding the standalone post to the sequence.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nEpistemic status: Mixed\n\nThe concept of question substitution, which underlies and informs this chapter, is one that is well-researched and well-documented, particularly in the work of Daniel Kahneman. The idea of “bucket errors” is one generated by CFAR staff and has no formal research behind it, but it has resonated with a majority of our alumni and seems like a reasonable model for a common class of human behaviors.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nHumans don’t simply experience reality. We interpret it.\n\nThere’s some evidence that this is true “all the way down,” for literally everything we perceive. The predictive processing model of cognition posits that even very basic sensations like sight and touch are heavily moderated by a set of top-down control systems, predictions, and assumptions—that even as the photons are hitting our receptors, we’re on some level anticipating them, already attempting to define them and categorize them and organize them into sensible clusters. It’s not just a swirl of green and brown, it’s a tree—and we almost can’t stop ourselves from seeing the tree, and go back to something like unmediated perception.\n\nCFAR’s concept of “buckets” is a similar idea on a broader scale. The claim is that reality is delivering to you a constant stream of experiences, and that—most of the time—you are categorizing those experiences into pre-existing mental buckets. Those buckets have titles like “do they like me?” and “is this a good idea?” and “what’s my boss like?” and “Chinese food?”\n\nIf you think of your mental architecture as being made up of a large number of beliefs, then the buckets contain the piles of evidence

The idea is that, much of the time, the colleague doesn’t actually have to say or do anything—the value comes from taking a vague sense of the problem and articulating it clearly enough for someone else to understand, and so explaining to a rubber duck does the trick without using up anyone else's time and attention. \n\nThe rubber duck is one model for how to help people “debug” the problems in their lives. You’re there so that they can clarify their own understanding, not to provide them with an outside solution.\n\nOf course, often people really could use some help, and a person can be useful in a way that even the best rubber duck can’t manage.

They’ll look at the amount of weight they can lift, and try to push the envelope. They’ll seek out more and more and more of whatever particular trait or thing they’re currently prioritizing—money, connection, excitement, knowledge.\n\nYou could think of life as a graph, where the X axis is time and the Y axis is the trait in question. In this maximizing mindset, the goal is to get the line as high as possible—or sometimes, for people who set process goals rather than outcome goals, to make the slope of the line as steep as possible.\n\nCFAR claims that this mindset is a mistake. Overt maximization often ignores other costs and constraints, like trying to get eight extra hours per day by not sleeping. It doesn’t work—or at least, not for very long.\n\nThe key insight is that the property we really care about is the area under the curve.\n\nYou could think of the total amount of awesomeness in a given week as being equal to the awesomeness-per-hour times the number of hours.
