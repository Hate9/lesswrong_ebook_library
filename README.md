# LessWrong Ebook Library
The LessWrong Community Sequences are now available in an easily accessible EPUB format, providing an alternative way to read the content offline on e-readers. The ebooks preserve the original visual content, including images and math, while offering a comfortable reading experience with features like adjustable font sizes and glare-free screens. The [source code](lwsequence_to_epub.py) for the scraping and generation of the ebooks, written in Python, is also available for those interested in generating their own copies.
