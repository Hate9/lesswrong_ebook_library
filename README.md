# LessWrong Ebook Library
This fork contains an updated script compared to the original.

It was going to contain a release of the entire library, until I realized how incredibly slow the program was.

I have now abandoned this project in favor of [LessPub](https://gitlab.com/MayESchaefer/lesspub), which is both significantly faster and probably kinder to LessWrong's servers, due to actually using their API.
